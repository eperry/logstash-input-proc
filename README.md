# Logstash Plugin

This is a plugin for [Logstash](https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash).

This plugin is to read the /proc virtual file system , decode the files in it.
I am using the following pages for reference 
-http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html

## Documentation


### 1. Plugin Developement and Testing

#### Code
- To get started, you'll need JRuby with the Bundler gem installed.
 ```sh
bundle install
```

- Then clone this repo
- You will need to either clone the logstash repo or download the binary



### 2. Running the unpublished Plugin in Logstash

#### 2.1 Run in a local Logstash clone

- Edit Logstash `Gemfile` and add the local plugin path, for example:
```ruby
gem "logstash-output-proc", :path => "/your/local/logstash-output-proc"
```
- Install plugin
```sh
bin/plugin install --no-verify
```
- install Ruby Debug
```sh
bin/plugin install logstash-codec-rubydebug
```
- Run Logstash with your plugin
```sh
bin/logstash -e 'input {proc {interval=>60}}  output { stdout{ codec=>"rubydebug"}}'
```
At this point any modifications to the plugin code will be applied to this local Logstash setup. After modifying the plugin, simply rerun Logstash.

#### 2.2 Run in an installed Logstash

You can use the same **2.1** method to run your plugin in an installed Logstash by editing its `Gemfile` and pointing the `:path` to your local plugin development directory or you can build the gem and install it using:

- Build your plugin gem
```sh
gem build logstash-output-proc.gemspec
```
- Install the plugin from the Logstash home
```sh
bin/plugin install /your/local/plugin/logstash-output-proc.gem
```
- Start Logstash and proceed to test the plugin
- 
# Example Config
```ruby
input {
    proc {
        interval=>60
    }
}  
output { 
    stdout{ 
        codec=>"rubydebug"
    }
}
```
